# Leaderboard

> In this activity you will set up a JavaScript project for the Leaderboard list app, using webpack and ES6 features, notably modules. You should develop a first working version of the app following a wireframe, but without styling - just focus on functionality. In following activities, you will consume the Leaderboard API using JavaScript async and await and add some styling.

Interaction with the leaderboard API
Each new game is created with the POST method using
    { 
        "name": "My cool new game" 
    }
This request returns a result that holds the unique ID for that game:

  {
    "result": "Game with ID: Zl4d7IVkemOTTVg2fUdz added."
  }
This gameID is saved in the localStorage automatically

The two allowed actions are psoting of scores and getting of the scores

The POST request creates a new Leaderboard score for the given game sending user and score as parameters like this:

Endpoint
https://us-central1-js-capstone-backend.cloudfunctions.net/api/games/:id/scores/
body parameters

{ 
    "user": "John Doe",
    "score": 42
}
and it returns

{
    "result": "Leaderboard score created correctly."
}
The GET request returns data in JSON format like this:

Endpoint
https://us-central1-js-capstone-backend.cloudfunctions.net/api/games/:id/scores/
It returns

{
  "result": [
      {
          "user": "John Doe",
          "score": 42
      },
      {
          "user": "Peter Parker",
          "score": 35
      },
      {
          "user": "Wonder Woman",
          "score": 50
      }
  ]
}
