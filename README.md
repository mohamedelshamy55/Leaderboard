# Leaderboard

> In this activity you will set up a JavaScript project for the Leaderboard list app, using webpack and ES6 features, notably modules. You should develop a first working version of the app following a wireframe, but without styling - just focus on functionality. In following activities, you will consume the Leaderboard API using JavaScript async and await and add some styling.
